# Frontend Git Ignore Configuration
# This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git
# 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
# - Git ignore patterns for React frontend project
# - Excludes build outputs, dependencies, and development files
# - Keeps repository clean and focused on source code
# - Standard patterns for Node.js and React projects
#
# CONNECTIONS:
# - Used by: Git version control system
# - Targets: Frontend-specific files and directories
# - Related to: package.json (dependencies), build outputs
# - Part of: Project-wide version control strategy
#
# IGNORED PATTERNS:
# - Logs: All log files and debug outputs
# - Dependencies: node_modules directory (managed by npm)
# - Build outputs: dist, dist-ssr directories
# - Editor files: IDE and editor-specific configurations
# - OS files: System files like .DS_Store
#
# USAGE:
# - Automatically applied by Git
# - Can be overridden with git add -f for specific files
# - Patterns are relative to the frontend directory

# Logs - All log files and debug outputs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
pnpm-debug.log*
lerna-debug.log*

# Dependencies and build outputs
node_modules      # npm dependencies (managed by package.json)
dist             # Production build output
dist-ssr         # Server-side rendering build output
*.local          # Local environment files

# Editor directories and files
.vscode/*         # VS Code settings (except extensions.json)
!.vscode/extensions.json  # Keep recommended extensions
.idea             # IntelliJ/WebStorm settings
.DS_Store         # macOS system files
*.suo             # Visual Studio user options
*.ntvs*           # Visual Studio project files
*.njsproj         # Visual Studio Node.js project
*.sln             # Visual Studio solution files
*.sw?             # Vim swap files
