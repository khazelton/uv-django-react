# Project-Wide Git Ignore Configuration
# This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git for the entire project
# 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
# - Git ignore patterns for the full-stack Django + React project
# - Covers both backend (Python/Django) and frontend (Node.js/React) files
# - Excludes build outputs, dependencies, and development artifacts
# - Keeps repository clean and focused on source code
#
# CONNECTIONS:
# - Used by: Git version control system for entire project
# - Targets: Both backend/ and frontend/ directories
# - Related to: backend/.venv/, frontend/node_modules/, build outputs
# - Part of: Project-wide version control strategy
#
# IGNORED PATTERNS:
# - Python: Compiled files, virtual environments, build artifacts
# - Django: Logs, local settings, database files
# - Node.js: Dependencies, logs, build outputs
# - Vite: Frontend build directory
# - General: Common development and system files
#
# USAGE:
# - Automatically applied by Git to all subdirectories
# - Can be overridden with git add -f for specific files
# - Patterns apply to the entire project structure

# Python Backend Files
__pycache__/          # Python bytecode cache directories
*.pyc                 # Compiled Python files
*.pyo                 # Optimized Python files
*.pyd                 # Python DLL files
.Python               # Python installation marker
env/                  # Virtual environment directory
venv/                 # Alternative virtual environment name
build/                # Python build artifacts
*.egg-info/           # Python package metadata

# Django Specific Files
*.log                 # Django and application logs
local_settings.py     # Local Django settings (not in version control)
db.sqlite3            # SQLite database file (development only)

# Node.js Frontend Files
node_modules/         # npm dependencies (managed by package.json)
*.log*                # Node.js and npm logs

# Vite Build Output
frontend/dist/        # Frontend production build directory
