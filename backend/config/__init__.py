# This empty __init__.py file makes the config directory a Python package
#

# - Allows Django to import config.settings, config.urls, etc.
# - Required for Django project structure
#
# CONNECTIONS:
# - Referenced by: manage.py, wsgi.py, asgi.py
# - Part of: Django project configuration structure
# - Related to: config/settings.py, config/urls.py, config/wsgi.py, config/asgi.py
#
# NOTE: This file is intentionally empty - Django only needs it to exist
