# Django API Tests
# This file contains test cases for the API app
# 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
# - Currently empty - no test cases defined yet
# - Placeholder for future unit and integration tests
# - Can be used to test API endpoints, models, and views
# - Ensures code quality and prevents regressions
#
# CONNECTIONS:
# - Imports: django.test.TestCase
# - Referenced by: Django test runner
# - Related to: api/views.py (views to test), api/models.py (models to test)
# - Part of: Django testing framework
#
# POTENTIAL TEST CASES:
# - Test ping endpoint returns correct response
# - Test API authentication and permissions
# - Test model validation and relationships
# - Test URL routing and view functions
# - Test CORS configuration
#
# USAGE:
# - Run tests: python manage.py test api
# - Run specific test: python manage.py test api.tests
# - Run with coverage: coverage run manage.py test api

from django.test import TestCase

# Create your tests here.
# 
# Example test case:
# class PingViewTest(TestCase):
#     def test_ping_endpoint(self):
#         """Test that ping endpoint returns correct response."""
#         response = self.client.get('/api/ping/')
#         self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
#         self.assertEqual(response.json(), {"message": "pong"})
# 
#     def test_ping_method_not_allowed(self):
#         """Test that POST to ping endpoint is not allowed."""
#         response = self.client.post('/api/ping/')
#         self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 405)
