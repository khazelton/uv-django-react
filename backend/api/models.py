# Django API Models
# This file defines database models for the API app
# 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
# - Currently empty - no database models defined yet
# - Placeholder for future database models
# - Can be used to define data structures for API responses
# - Models would be automatically created in the database via migrations
#
# CONNECTIONS:
# - Imports: django.db.models
# - Referenced by: Django ORM system
# - Related to: api/migrations/ (database schema changes)
# - Part of: Django app structure
#
# POTENTIAL USAGE:
# - Define User models for authentication
# - Create data models for API responses
# - Define relationships between different data types
# - Generate database tables automatically
#
# NOTE: This file is intentionally empty for now
# When models are added, run: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
# 
# Example model structure:
# class ExampleModel(models.Model):
#     name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     description = models.TextField()
#     created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
#     
#     def __str__(self):
#         return self.name
