# Django Admin Configuration
# This file configures the Django admin interface for the API app
# 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
# - Currently empty - no models registered for admin interface
# - Placeholder for future admin interface customization
# - Can be used to manage API data through Django's built-in admin
# - Provides web-based interface for database management
#
# CONNECTIONS:
# - Imports: django.contrib.admin
# - Referenced by: Django admin system
# - Related to: api/models.py (models to register)
# - Part of: Django admin interface at /admin/
#
# POTENTIAL USAGE:
# - Register models for CRUD operations
# - Customize admin interface appearance
# - Add custom admin actions
# - Control user permissions and access
#
# NOTE: This file is intentionally empty for now
# When models are added, register them here for admin access

from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
# 
# Example registration:
# from .models import ExampleModel
# 
# @admin.register(ExampleModel)
# class ExampleModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
#     list_display = ['name', 'created_at']
#     search_fields = ['name', 'description']
#     list_filter = ['created_at']
